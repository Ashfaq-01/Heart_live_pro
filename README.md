# Heart_live_pro
This goal of this project is to make a machine learning model which can accuratly predict the chances of a person developing a heart ailment.
This Model takes in certain parameters like blood cholesterol , blood sugar level etc from the user and compiles them using the Logistic Regression algorithm and gives its best prediction.

The model is built in python using the pandas , numpy and sklearn libraries the source code to which can be found in  Heart_predict.py.
to Provide a better user interface, I have used the Python NUI framework Kivy, the code for which can be found in my.kv.
